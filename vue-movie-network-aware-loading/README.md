# Demo: Vue-movie network-aware resource loading in Vue

[Vue Movie](https://github.com/oliver-gomes/react-movie) is an application for browsing the latest movies, viewing summaries of them and seeing a cast list.

This version of Vue movie uses network-aware loading to determine whether to load low-fidelity or high-fidelity movie posters based on the user's effective connection type (e.g 2G -> lo-fi, 4G -> hi-fi).
